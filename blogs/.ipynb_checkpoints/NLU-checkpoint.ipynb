    "Natural Language processing is perhaps the most mysterious part of AI, especially given how easy it is to model natural language information in computer systems. Even using a simple neural network (a math-based model) to run a single sentence, an agent is still too complex to discern with any confidence what it is intended to say.\n",

    "Natural Language processing is a branch of cognitive science which explores the way our brains deal with language. Similar to other cognitive science projects, Chomsky's method entails studying natural languages which have been learned by humans and put into a digital format. By simply applying a machine learning algorithm to the database of speech data, a robot can learn to speak naturally and as quickly as a real person.\n",

    "Natural Language processing is the study of information gathered by humans from and through text, images, sounds, and other forms of communication. It also includes parsing and interpreting of that information and its associated grammatical structures and rules. These challenges are often represented as specific tasks for artificial intelligence—such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language understanding, or the detection of sentiment or emotional bias in written messages—where natural language processing is performed on a text-based language or a non-text. Although these NLP challenges may be more interesting to researchers in that area, they are sometimes conflated with domain-specific task problems such as the implementation and analysis of machine learning models.\n",

    "Natural Language Generation is a specification for a general-purpose and generic grammar-based natural language generative system. The goal is to be able to generate sentences that are a subset of natural languages as far as accuracy, meaning, and expressive power are concerned. The system must be sensitive to syntax (allowing the programmer to specify how certain symbols must be entered) and semantics (be capable of generating sentences according to rules specified by the user). The main goal of the system is not to model languages, but to be easy to use, general-purpose, and extensible.\n",
